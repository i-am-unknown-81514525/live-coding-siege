### LiveCoding rule

When the magician picks you, it's your time to perform!

#### The Selection Process
You can be selected multiple times in a single huddle, but not consecutively. (We are not that evil)
You can tell the magician to not select you by clicking a button.


#### Your Turn
- **Setup**: You have 2 minutes to set up your stream. If you fail, you are automatically skipped.
- **Duration**: You will stream for 5 to 20 minutes (decided by the bot).
- **Skipping**: You can skip if you are not available. **HOWEVER**, if you skip twice in a row without doing a live coding session, you will not be picked again for the rest of the huddle.

#### Completion Requirements
To successfully complete a live coding session, you must:
- Be on the huddle for 90% of your assigned time.
- Be streaming for 80% of your assigned time.
- All activity performed on the screen share must be hackatime tracked toward your siege project (The only exclusion is researching on your browser for your siege project, which isn't trackable).
- Don't vibe code on stream :heavysob:

#### Rewards
For every live coding session you complete, you can obtain 2 coins (for now).

#### End of Huddle
The huddle ends when no one monitoring the huddle status is available, or when no valid participants can be selected to continue the event.
(For Saturday huddle, I will be available until at least 20:00 BST)

#### Rule updates
21/10 - The selection chance is not same not for Siege. The bot will only selected user with a existing Siege project, and the chance of selection increase as the hackatime tracked on the siege project increase. (Each eligible participant would start with 10 ticket, and get a ticket for every 0.1 hours coded in the event. The bot would pick a ticket and the corresponding participant will be selected for the performance)
