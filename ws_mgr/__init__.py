# Btw this is code from my old project (the entire directory) that I think is helpful for me, consider this as a library (however the old project isn't public)
# For specific signals.py however, it is in https://github.com/i-am-unknown-81514525/signal/blob/main/src/signals/signals.py
# just consider them as library, thx!
